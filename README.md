# Screenwerk-2016

1. clone the code
2. ~cd app~
3. npm install
4. [SCREEN_EID=6534 ]npm start

* On first run, start the player with  
  * *nix:
    `SCREEN_EID=6534 npm start`  
  * win:
    `set SCREEN_EID=6534`  
    `npm start`  

later on `npm start` is sufficient. Provide SCREEN_EID environment variable only if changing the screen.

Screen credentials are stored in .../home/screen.yml - you can always update the contents manually, also.
