## Crontab
is used for generating named system events at certain moments.

## Event
SW events are "things" that happen inside ScreenWerk.  
Elements can subscribe and "react" on these events.

Every element emits started and stopped events.
In addition every element could emit custom named, delayed events:

- <Id> Playback started
- <Id> Playback stopped
- <Id> My custom event label

System events:

- Player started - emitted once when all elements are loaded and subscriptions registered.

## Configuration
is a set of Crontab items that a screen can be tied to.

## Action

- Media actions:
  - Start playback
  - Stop playback
  - Emit delayed event

## Subscription

    ---
    - subscriptionId: 1
      listener: 1
