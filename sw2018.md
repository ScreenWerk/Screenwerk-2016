Elements can subscribe and "react" on these events.

Every element emits started and stopped events.
In addition every element could start timers and emit custom named events.
- <Id> Playback started
- <Id> Playback stopped
- <Id> My custom event label

System events:
- Player started - emitted once when all elements are loaded and subscriptions registered.

## Configuration

## Action

  - Start playback
  - Stop playback
  - Start timer <time, "Start/Stop">

## Subscription
